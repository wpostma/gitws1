# Warren's GO Workspace for Windows

Contains a hacked up fork of Gitlab CI Multi Runner that can be used to debug Shell (cmd.exe batch file) integration directly on Windows, and attempt various patches and hacks.

The regular upstream Gitlab CI multi runner has dependencies on Unix/Linux/docker bits that don't seem to be easy (if even possible) to get working/buildable on Windoze boxen.
